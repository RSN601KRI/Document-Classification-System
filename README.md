# Classification and Processing of Unstructured Financial Documents

## **Overview**
Appian Credit Union handles thousands of financial documents daily, including applications, identity documents, financial records, and receipts. This project aims to automate the classification and summarization of these documents, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

---

## **Problem Statement**
1. Documents are currently manually verified and organized, leading to:
   - **Time inefficiency**.
   - **Repetitive tasks** for employees.
   - **High error rates** in document processing.
2. Need for technology to provide a first "best effort" categorization and summarization of documents.

---

## **Proposed Solution**
### **Objective**
Leverage OCR, NLP, and a web-based platform to:
- **Automate document categorization** by person and document type.
- **Summarize essential information** for easier processing.
- **Provide a user-friendly interface** for employees to review and manage documents.

### **Key Features**
1. **Hierarchical Categorization**:
   - Associate documents with the correct person using metadata like names and government IDs.
   - Classify by document type (e.g., identity documents, receipts).
2. **Summarization**:
   - Extract and display critical data from documents.
3. **Web Interface**:
   - A dashboard for uploading, searching, and reviewing documents.

---

## **Workflow**
### **Step-by-Step Implementation**
1. **Document Upload**: Users upload files through a web interface.
2. **Data Extraction**:
   - Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction.
   - NLP models process and extract metadata (e.g., names, ID numbers).
3. **Document Categorization**:
   - Assign documents to the correct person.
   - Group by type (e.g., tax returns, pay stubs).
4. **Storage**:
   - Save documents and metadata in a structured database.
5. **Display on Dashboard**:
   - Present categorized documents with options for search and download.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- **AI/ML Tools**:
  - OCR: OpenCV, Tesseract.
  - NLP: spaCy, TensorFlow.
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

---

## **Benefits**
1. **Efficiency**: Reduces document processing time by 70-80%.
2. **Accuracy**: Minimizes human error in classification.
3. **Scalability**: Can handle increasing document volumes.
4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface for employees.

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **AI-Driven Insights**:
   - Generate risk assessments and summaries from documents.
2. **Integration with CRM Systems**:
   - Connect with existing banking systems for seamless workflows.
3. **Mobile App**:
   - Enable document uploads and processing on the go.
4. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data during storage and transfer.
